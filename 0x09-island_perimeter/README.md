# Island perimeter interview
In this project we create a function that calculates the perimeter of an island represented by a grid:
1. grid is a list of list of integers:
2. 0 represents water
3. 1 represents land
4. Each cell is square, with a side length of 1
5. Cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
6. grid is rectangular, with its width and height not exceeding 100
7. The grid is completely surrounded by water
8. There is only one island (or nothing).
9. The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to the water surrounding the island).

#project requirements
In this project we are expected to use Vi, Vim or emacs editors but not VSCode. A README file (which you are reading right now) is mandatory at the root folder of the project. This project will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. This project should also follow the {E{8 standard. We will use Pycodestyle to check that the codes conform to this standard.
