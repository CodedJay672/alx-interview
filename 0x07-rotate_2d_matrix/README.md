# ALX Interview
This project is focused on testing out some technical interview questions in python.

This project is focused on getting a 2D matrix to be rotated by 90 degress in the clockwise direction. This makes the rows to become columns and the columns to become rows.

## Project Requirements
This prooject requires that only Vi, Vim and emacs editors are used. Pushing codes from other Editors like VSCode will cause the checker to produce a permission denied result instead of checking the results in your github repository.
